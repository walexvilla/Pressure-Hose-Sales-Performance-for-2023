Methodology
The dashboard analysis was conducted using the following approach:

Aggregation of Sales Data
Sales amounts were aggregated by month, city, state, customer, product category, and salesperson to identify patterns and trends.
Comparative Analysis
Performance across cities, regions, products, and sales reps was compared to identify top and bottom performers.
Trend Analysis
Monthly sales trends were analysed to identify seasonality, peaks, and dips in performance.
Distribution Analysis
Transaction values were grouped into ranges to understand whether revenue is driven by many small transactions or fewer large ones.
Filtering and Segmentation
Filters (customer, salesperson, city, region, product) allow deeper drill-down to uncover more specific insights.
Data Breakdown
Geographic Performance
New York is the top city for:
Shipping revenue
Overall revenue ($67,180.50)
Other strong cities include Portland and Miami
State-level performance highlights stronger sales concentration in the East region
Sales Trend Over Time
Sales fluctuate across the year
December ($66,642.78) is the highest-performing month
Other strong months: June and October
Weaker months: February and April
This indicates seasonal buying behaviour, with demand increasing toward year-end.

Transaction Distribution
Most transactions fall within the lowest value range
Very few high-value transactions occur
Revenue is driven by volume rather than deal size
Product Category Performance
Beverages is the best-performing product category ($110,577.11)
Followed by:
Sauces
Jams
Canned and dried fruit products perform the weakest
Sales Representative Performance
Nancy Freehafer is the top-performing salesperson ($104,252.34)
A noticeable gap exists between top and lower-performing reps
Customer Performance
Company D is the top customer ($67,180.50)
Revenue is concentrated among the Top 10 customers
Potential Insights
Revenue Concentration Risk
Sales are heavily dependent on a few:
Cities (New York)
Customers (Company D)
Sales reps (Nancy Freehafer)
Strong Seasonal Effect
Sales spike in Q4, especially December, suggesting demand driven by seasonal purchasing or promotions.
Product Dependency
Beverages dominate sales, meaning overall revenue is vulnerable if demand for this category declines.
Transaction Behaviour
Customers prefer frequent low-value purchases rather than large orders.
Performance Gap Among Sales Reps
Significant differences suggest uneven skill distribution or territory opportunity.
Recommendations
Sales Strategy
Replicate top sales rep strategies (Nancy Freehafer) through training or mentoring
Introduce upselling and bundling to increase average transaction value
Geographic Expansion
Strengthen presence in high-performing regions
Develop targeted strategies to grow underperforming cities and states
Product Portfolio
Continue investing in Beverages while promoting underperforming categories
Use cross-selling (e.g., beverages + sauces)
Customer Management
Protect and reward top customers
Reduce dependency by expanding the customer base
Seasonal Planning
Increase marketing and inventory ahead of Q4 peak periods
Introduce promotions during low-performing months (Feb–Apr)
